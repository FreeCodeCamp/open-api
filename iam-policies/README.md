# IAM policies

Policies in this directories are _not_ managed but have been used to create
an IAM user to deploy Lambdas with.

When freeCodeCamp starts managing their AWS accounts programatically.
Possibly with a tool like Terraform, these policies should be pulled into the
controlling repository.

iam-policies/open-api-policy.json was generated using [serverless-policy](https://github.com/dancrumb/generator-serverless-policy).
